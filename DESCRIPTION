Description: Functions for demographic and epidemiological analysis in
  the Lexis diagram, i.e. register and cohort follow-up data. In
  particular representation, manipulation, rate estimation and
  simulation for multistate data - the Lexis suite of functions, which
  includes interfaces to 'mstate', 'etm' and 'cmprsk' packages.
  Contains functions for Age-Period-Cohort and Lee-Carter modeling and
  a function for interval censored data. Has functions for extracting
  and manipulating parameter estimates and predicted values (ci.lin
  and its cousins), as well as a number of epidemiological data sets.
